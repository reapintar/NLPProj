However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not. For more, visit www.cisur.ca.\n----------------------------\nTo find help for a child or youth, you can: \n Encourage your child to talk to a teacher or school counsellor \n Talk to your family doctor or pediatrician, or go to a walk-in clinic \n Contact your local Child & Youth Mental Health office on one of their walk-in days \n Use Kelty Mental Health’s Help Finder Tool to find specific services and providers \n Contact the Institute of Families for Child and Youth Mental Health’s Youth-in-Residence or Parent-in-Residence for guidance, information, and support. Youth-in-Residence and Parents-in-Residence are located around the province. If you don’t have one in your community, a Parent- or Youth-in-Residence at the Kelty Mental Health Resource Centre can help you by phone or email \n Visit www.familysmart.ca for information and resources on child and youth mental health \n For young people ages 12-24, visit foundrybc.ca to see if there is a Foundry Centre in your area. Foundry offers easy-to-access mental health care, physical health care, social services, and support out of one office.\n----------------------------\nMental health services like counselling or therapy may be covered by your BC Medical Services Plan (MSP) when you access the service through a hospital or mental health clinic. Find your local health authority to learn more about counselling services in your area. HealthLink BC’s Find Services tool and Locator app can also help you find services. You often need a doctor’s referral to access these types of programs. \n Without a doctor’s referral, you need to access care through the private system, which is not funded by the government. Private mental health services can be expensive. This can be a real barrier to finding good care. While there is no simple answer, there are several different places you can look: \n If you have health benefits at work, ask about your coverage. Some plans will cover a certain number of private counselling or therapy sessions. In addition, a workplace Employee/Family Assistance Plan may offer some services or may refer you to community services. \n Some psychologists, clinical counsellors, or other service providers may offer a sliding scale, which means that their costs are based on your income. Try contacting service providers directly to ask if they offer a sliding scale. One private clinic in Vancouver has a good list of lower-cost counselling options in the Vancouver area. For those outside of the Lower Mainland, you can still look at this list and see if any similar organizations might be in your community. \n Contact a mental health organization like Anxiety Canada, the Canadian Mental Health Association, BC Schizophrenia Society, Institute of Families for Child and Youth Mental Health, Mood Disorders Association of BC, or Jessie’s Legacy. They may offer services in your area, or they may have local connections that they can refer you to. \n You can also email us and we’ll try and give you some recommendations for your community.\n----------------------------\nProdrome is a medical term for early signs or symptoms of an illness or health problem that appear before the major signs or symptoms start. \n Psychosis, a group of symptoms found in disorders like schizophrenia, is one illness with a specific prodrome. With psychosis, prodrome signs and symptoms start before full symptoms like hallucinations and delusions appear. \n Common symptoms in the prodrome of psychosis include: \n These symptoms are found in many other mental illnesses, so it isn’t always clear at the time if this is a prodrome of psychosis or schizophrenia or something else. It’s best to seek help whenever you are concerned about your mental health or a loved one’s mental health.
